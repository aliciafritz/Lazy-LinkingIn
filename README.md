Project Title:
Lazy-LinkingIn

Description:
Staying connected with professional colleagues who are most likely to have the greatest value and benefit to sustained engagement is challenging once oneâ€™s network surpasses 100 contacts. The problem to address is how to identify the best network connections in an effective and time-efficient way.

Team Members:
Alicia Fritz & Jens Hansen

Potential Challenges:
1. A technical challenge you foresee - We both have limited overall programming experience, making us uncertain about which programming tools and techniques would be most suitable for the project.
2. A challenges regarding your process - Potential challenges may arise due to conflicting work schedules and time zone differences.
3. A challenge regarding the team composition or available skills - As previously mentioned, we both have limited programming experience, which might pose some challenges along the way. Without prior experience, it can be hard to know what to look for/look up when you run into an issue, or you may be unknowingly doing things the hard way. Also, when we read over each other's code, it will likely be hard to catch mistakes or issues.
